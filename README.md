# preliminary-dignostic-system-for-eye-defects-using-deep-learning

This is a deep learning based diagnostic system for eye defects that have
strong prediction power, interpretability, accuracy and efficiency for diagnosis of various eye
diseases or defects. Medical health systems have been concentrating on artificial intelligence
techniques for speedy diagnosis. However, the recording of health data in a standard form still
requires attention so that deep learning can be more accurate and reliable by considering
multiple features. Four machine learning algorithms VGG-16, VGG-19, InceptionResnetV2,
Xception algorithms were used to analyze patient data based on multiple features, including age,
illness history and clinical observations. The methodology used in this system was the Waterfall
Development method. The study collected data from the UCI Machine Learning website. The
dataset includes the characteristics collected from the image of Messidor to forecast the
existence of a diseased image or not.
The system is designed to evolve through self-learning by adding new classifications for both
diagnosis and symptoms. The classification results from training the different models which
demonstrate that the proposed framework performs satisfactorily, given a sufficient amount of
data. Owing to a structured data arrangement, the InceptionResNetV2 and Xception model has
higher accuracy rate of 0.8906 and 0.8875 respectively; Which is more when compared to the
other models in the system. Based on the prediction, the final score demonstrate the best training
model for the system, where Xception model has the highest final score of 0.7402. Using
deep learning approaches based is a promising approaching order to facilitate accuracy and
a more efficient, reliable diagnostic system.
